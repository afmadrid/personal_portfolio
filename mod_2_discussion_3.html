							<h2>Data Protection Commission (2020) Case of Study: Personal data of a third party withheld from an access request made by the parent of a minor.</h2>
							<br/>
							<h2 class="header blue"><u>Initial Post</u></h2>
							<p>In this case of study a parent requested personal information on behalf of his child at a sports centre. The sports centre provided partial information contained on the membership form given when the child was registered. Nevertheless, information such as emergency contacts was not given because it contained personal data of third parties such as names, phones, address, etc. (Data Protection Commission, 2017).</p>
							<p>According to the GDPR personal data can be considered any data related to an individual that makes possible to recognize in any way its identity. Even data such as an IP address or an identity cookie can be considered as personal data (ICO, 2020).</p>
							<p>The right of access is described by the GDPR as the right of any individual to request a copy of its own personal data, this request is normally known as subject access request (SAR). It also recognizes the case in which a third party such as a parent can make a request on behalf of child if they consent, and it is evident that the request considers the best interests of the child. Nevertheless, if the requested information involves third parties, the request may not proceed without the consent of the third parties (ICO, 2020).</p>
							<p>As described in the case of study the parent did not receive the complete information, because the information contained personal data related to third parties included as emergency contacts and they did not consent for their information to be provided. From the perspective of the sports centre, it is evident that they acted according to GDPR rules by negating access to the third parties’ personal data without their consent.</p>

							<h2 class="header blue"><u>Peer Response 1</u></h2>
							<p>In the case of study "Prosecution of AA Ireland Limited" it can be appreciated that correct measures of privacy and data protection were not applied in the organisational processes of the company. One suggested measure of mitigation that companies should integrate to minimize human errors related to privacy of personal data is the adherence of ‘privacy by design’ to practices followed in the organisation. Privacy by design proposes seven foundational principles to implement privacy and personal data protection since the beginning and during the development of a product and not at the end when it can result complicated to implement privacy requirements to fix privacy filtrations such as the one mentioned in the case of study (Cavoukian, 2011).</p>
							<p>Within the foundational principles of privacy by design, the principles of privacy by default and privacy embedded to the design are mentioned. The first principle states that all personal data should be automatically protected with the necessary privacy measures for any IT system and business practice. The second mentions that privacy should be considered as an essential component in any functionality to be delivered (Cavoukian, 2011).</p>
							<p>The GDPR considers privacy by design a mandatory measure to be integrated into the processing activities and business practices of an organisation throughout the entire product lifecycle. The GDPR renames this concept as ‘data protection by design and default’ (ICO, 2020).</p>

							<p>According to the GDPR any individual which personal data is collected have the right to be informed about the purpose of its personal data being collected and used. From this principle, the concept of ‘privacy information’ is remarked, which states that organisations have the obligation to inform individuals the purpose of processing their personal data, the time it will be retained and with who it will be shared. This information must be presented in a concise, transparent, accessible and easy to understand manner to the individuals (ICO, 2020). In the case of study: "The Dublin Mint Office Limited", it is clear that the company was not compliant with the right of being informed and privacy information.</p>
							<p>Another GDPR related principle to this case of study is the ‘purpose limitation’ principle, according to Hahn (2021), it states that personal data must be recollected for purposes clearly defined and it should not be used in a way that results incompatible with those purposes. By recollecting personal data such as telephone numbers and not being transparent with the purpose of using that information the after mentioned company was not compliant with this principle.</p>
							<p>As it was stated in your post companies should be more careful describing the real purposes of all requested personal data and not using it in a way that benefits them such as using it for  marketing purposes.</p>

							<h2 class="header blue"><u>Summary Post</u></h2>
							<p>By analysing the cases of study, it was possible to comprehend the responsibility and the difficulties that the organisations may confront to follow the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations). On some occasions it is difficult to make decisions that will protect the personal data of individuals and will allow organisations to use it without violating any law.</p>
							<p>GDPR are laws established in the European Union that are used around the world. These laws were created to protect privacy and security of the information collected from individuals and used by organisations. Organisations are obliged to follow GDPR to avoid economic penalizations that can fluctuate in the order of millions of euros (GDPR (a), 2022).</p>
							<p>To understand the obligations, organisations must understand its position as a data collector or processor. In general data collectors have more obligations, because they must demonstrate the purpose and usage that will be given to the collected personal data. Data processors receive the data, and they process it to accomplish a particular goal (ICO, 2022).</p>
							<p>Principles such as the right of access and data protection by design and default are presented in the GDPR. In overall the former discusses the right of any individual to access the information that has been collected concerning him or her and to know the purpose of why it is collected (GDPR (b), 2022). The second presents privacy and data protection as an integral element that must be embedded throughout all processes performed in an organisation (GDPR (c), 2022).</p>
							<p>As presented in the case of study, even if the parent had the right of access their child information collected by the sports centre. Information concerning third parties has not disclosed to protect their information (Data Protection Commission, 2017). Deep understanding of GDPR is required to detect any possible violation from collectors, processors and individuals.</p>
